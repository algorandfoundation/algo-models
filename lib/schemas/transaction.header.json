      "description": "A lease enforces mutual exclusion of transactions. If this field is nonzero, then once the transaction is confirmed, it acquires the lease identified by the (Sender, Lease) pair of the transaction until the LastValid round passes. While this transaction possesses the lease, no other transaction specifying this lease can be confirmed. A lease is often used in the context of Algorand Smart Contracts to prevent replay attacks. Read more about Algorand Smart Contracts. Leases can also be used to safeguard against unintended duplicate spends. For example, if I send a transaction to the network and later realize my fee was too low, I could send another transaction with a higher fee, but the same lease value. This would ensure that only one of those transactions ends up getting confirmed during the validity period."
